# Audio Files

Add your music files here:

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `loading.mp3` (or `.ogg`) | Plays while waiting for classmates on the loading screen |
| `presentation.mp3` (or `.ogg`) | Plays during the stand up presentation |

**Formats:** MP3 and OGG are supported. Include at least one format for each track.

**Note:** Browsers often block autoplay until the user interacts with the page. The first click/keypress will start the loading music (if it hadn't already) and then dismiss to the presentation with its own music.
